# Arduino Clock with TM1637 
### Introduction
This Arduino project is a simple yet effective digital clock utilizing the TM1637 LED display module. 
The TM1637 is a popular 4-digit, 7-segment LED display driver that makes it easy to create digital clocks, timers, and other time-based projects.

## Features
- Display current time in hours and minutes.
- Adjustable brightness levels for the LED display.
- Easy-to-understand codebase for customization and learning.

## Components Required
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- TM1637 4-digit 7-segment LED display module
- Jumper wires

## Wiring Instructions
Connect the TM1637 module to the Arduino board as follows:

- VCC to 5V on Arduino
- GND to GND on Arduino
- DIO to Digital Pin 11 on Arduino
- CLK to Digital Pin 10 on Arduino
 
## Installation
- Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the Arduino IDE.
- Download the  <TM1637Display.h> lib
- Load the sketch file (Arduino_Clock_TM1637.ino) from the project folder.
- Verify and upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

## Usage
- Power up your Arduino board.
- The clock will start displaying the current time.
- Use the buttons to Modify the Time.
Customization
Feel free to modify the code to add new features or adjust the behavior of the clock. The code is well-commented to guide you through the different sections.


## Troubleshooting
 If you encounter issues, double-check the wiring connections and ensure that the necessary libraries are installed in your Arduino IDE.
